extra frontend ideas:
- instead of highlighting the grid have it move a chess piece
- if it hits the king knock it over

- figure out the highlighting thing
- add highlighter as cursor
- add pages for video explore and download
- redesign responsive navbar
- add noise background to add more texture for the design
- review and clean up any design stuff

- mongo db cluster is exposed (delete after?)

extra side things:
- only works with videos with subtitles (cause of how we're getting the text)
- use intel ai computer to fine tune llm to avoid halluncinations
